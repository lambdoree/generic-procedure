# generic-procedure

This project implements a **generic procedure system** in **Clojure/ClojureScript (CLJC)**,  
inspired by the principles of _Software Design for Flexibility_.

The code is distributed under the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**,  
and is designed to support flexible and extensible programming paradigms.

## Included Implementations

### Procedure System

- **Most Specific Generic Procedure**  
  (dispatch based on the most specific type match)
- **Chaining Generic Procedure**  
  (allowing multiple handlers to cooperate sequentially)

### Type System

- **Simple Type**  
  (basic atomic types)
- **Compound Type**  
  (logical combinations such as conjunctions and disjunctions)
- **Parametric Type**  
  (types parameterized by other types, e.g., ListOf[T])
